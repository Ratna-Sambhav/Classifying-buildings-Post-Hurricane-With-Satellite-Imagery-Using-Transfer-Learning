# Classifying-buildings-Post-Hurricane-using-Satellite-Imagery
This project is to see the performance of different transfer learning models on classifying buildings as damaged or not damaged. The part of the image which the DL model focussed on in the classification process, is also before the conclusion part of the notebook. Further details are in the notebook itself.
